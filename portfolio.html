            <p><em>Peace: An Automization</em> was created and exhibited in "The Quest for Peace" student exhibition and explores the relationships between various characteristics of human society within the context of peace. The work feaures a continously growing collection of artifacts representing different aspects of a society. The encapsulated objects ask the viewer to metaphorically confront the infrastructure of peace itself.</p>
            <p>In this interactive piece viewers are encouraged to arrange the components within the blueprint outline as they see fit. The viewer must decide which elements are necessary to build their representation of peace while staying within the blueprint parameters. However the outlines were purposely designed to be disproportionate leaving the goal impossible to achieve. In this piece, the faux-scientific outline alludes to the seemingly concrete definition of the man-made concept of peace and how it is unnatural and unrealistic.</p>

            <p>Visual study of installation <em>Room</em>. Text includes: "Is the alphabet in order? Currently we use rhymes to organize.. We have created some semblance of order from chaos-an arbitrary colletion of sounds""Structure, organization, reason, meaning.. it is a basic anamalistic need humans crave. Chaos makes us uncomfortable and meaninglessness (if it truly exists) holds nothing. But chaos is not nothingness. It is something we are unable decipher definitive, tangible definition/pattern/structure yet as human beings we still try.</p> 
            <p><em>Room</em> presents the viewer with a sporadically placed list of letters which they confront in whatever order they choose. Their results will be given to them to place on a wall of results. Viewers are exposed to chaos and subconsciously will sort through the jumbled letters in attempt to organize/create words on the wall. Everything we have been taught has been based on pattern. Patterns create a sense of meaning. This piece dissects our reliance on patterns to define existence.</p>
