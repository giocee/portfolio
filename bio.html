      <section id="aboutme2">
         <p>Currently, I am finishing my Bachelor of Science Degree in Digital Humanities, specializing in information architecture and minoring in psychology at Illinois Institute of Technology.</p>
         <p>Because I am still completing my degree, I do not have any formal experience in the ux field. However, as seen in my portfolio, my passion for studying human behavior in various environments can be seen throughout my educational career, even serving as the driving force behind much of the work I completed as an undergraduate fine arts major. Through my fine arts background, I was able to sharpen my visual design knowledge and skill set. While in my current degree, I have been able to build my technical skill set, working with the latest technologies for wire framing, prototyping, and responsive design across multiple platforms.</p>  
         <p>Along with my passion and knowledge, my retail management experience serves as evidence of my ability to communicate clearly and work with multiple teams in order to set and reach common goals.</p>   
         <p>The technology industry is in the process of moving into a new, more inclusive, user centered direction in order to remain innovative in a highly competitive market. I am confident my education and management experience demonstrate the forward-thinking, motivated attitude I can bring to your staff.</p>
